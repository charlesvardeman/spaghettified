Command line arguments and options parsing is handled by getopt_long.  The code to handle them
is generated by gengetopt (http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html).  It is
available from the yum EPEL repo or by building manually.

To build gengetopt, download from links in download section:

./configure
make
sudo make install

This installs it globally.  The option configuration is found in src/commandopts.ggo. To generate
the option code (this only needs to be done when options are changed):

gengetopt < commandopts.ggo

This will create cmdline.h and cmdline.c in the directory where it is run.  Put cmdline.h and cmdline.c
in src/.  This will automatically handle parsing argv, provide defaults and values provided and provide
the non-option args as well.

The jsoncpp library is required for this project.  Version 0.5.0 is included in this directory. Simply
run jsoncpp_0.5.0_build.sh to build it and move the files into place.

There is the build.sh script to build the executable.
